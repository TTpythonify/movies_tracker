all that is left is notifcations.
Get notification when someone gives a review to a movie u already planning to watch


Display watched and watch later

and add upvote and downvote to the reviews



to run   docker-compose up --build



how notifications work. so 

i add something to watch list, so i store that movie id
someone else then comments on that. before i insert, i get the people that has that movie id in watch list
i then send them a message
then add that comment to the movie
